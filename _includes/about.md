I work for [Info Tech](https://www.infotechfl.com) in Gainesville, FL. At my job, we use Ruby on Rails to write awesome applications to help construction companies, and we apply the DevOps culture on a daily basis.

I am also an open source enthusiast. I like to turn cool ideas into projects, contribute to [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), and write for the [This Week in Rails](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com) newsletter.

When not coding, I am probably cooking or traveling. Check out my [blog](/blog){% if site.twitter_username %} and [tweets](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}){% endif %} for cool updates!
